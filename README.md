# we-have-tiktok-at-home

This repository and accompanying GitHub projects serve as a blueprint for managing the development of a software product.

In our case, it's a TikTok-like application.

See our [Roadmap](github.com/orgs/inno-swp-2025/projects/5/views/4), [Product Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/inno-swp-2025/projects/1), and [Tasks](https://github.com/orgs/inno-swp-2025/projects/2).

## Set up your project

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) a GitHub organization.
1. [Import](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-github-importer/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer) or [transfer](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) your repositories into your organization.
1. Import the [.github](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025/.github) repository into your organization.
1. Create issue types (see [Issue types](#issue-types)).
1. Create issue labels (see [Issue labels](#issue-labels)).
1. Copy our projects (see [Projects](#projects)).
1. Create issues following the [work items hierarchy](#work-items-hierarchy) and using [issue form templates](#issue-form-templates).
1. Set `Priority` and `Story Points` in your type `Backlog` issues (see [Project `Product Backlog`](#project-product-backlog)).
1. If some type `Backlog` issues with label `Backlog: User Story` are too large, convert them into type `Epic` issues and add there smaller type `Backlog` sub-issues.
1. Set `Start` and `Finish` in your type `Epic` issues (see [Project `Roadmap`](#project-roadmap)).
1. Create milestones in the project `Roadmap` and add type `Epic` issues to these milestones.
1. Set `Ideal Hours` and `Priority` in your type `Task` issues (see [Project `Tasks`](#project-tasks)).
1. Set matching `Sprint` in your type `Backlog` issues and their type `Task` sub-issues.
1. Adjust the entry criteria specified in Kanban boards in the `Roadmap` and `Product Backlog` projects. Criteria for a column specify when an issue can be moved to that column.

## Work items hierarchy

We use the following hierarchy of work items represented via different types of issues and pull requests.

## Issues

We created several sample [issues](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025/we-have-tiktok-at-home/issues) in the [inno-swp-2025/we-have-tiktok-at-home](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025) repository.

### Issue types

Each issue has a [type](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/managing-issue-types-in-an-organization).

Types:

- `Epic` - a large user story.
- `Backlog` - a Product Backlog Item (PBI).
- `Task` - a task related to a PBI.

### Issue labels

Additionally, issues have meaningful [labels](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025/we-have-tiktok-at-home/labels).

If you plan to have several repositories in your organization, you can [create default issue labels](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-default-labels-for-repositories-in-your-organization).

### Compatibility of issue types and labels

|                | `Epic` | `Backlog` | `Task` |
| -------------- | :----: | :-------: | :----: |
| `Priority: *`  |   ✅   |    ✅     |   ✅   |
| `Meta: *`      |   ✅   |    ✅     |   ✅   |
| `Platform: *`  |   ✅   |    ✅     |   ✅   |
| `Backlog: *`   |   ❌   |    ✅     |   ❌   |
| `Severity: *`  |   ❌   |    ✅     |   ❌   |
| `Scope: *`     |   ❌   |    ❌     |   ✅   |
| `Component: *` |   ❌   |    ❌     |   ✅   |

Legend:

- Columns - issue types.
- Rows - issue labels.
- ✅ - compatible
- ❌ - incompatible

### Epics and Product Backlog Items

Epics break down into Product Backlog Items (see [Work items hierarchy](#work-items-hierarchy)).

Each sub-issue of a type `Epic` issue must have one of these labels:

- `Backlog: User Story`
- `Backlog: Enabler`
- `Backlog: Investigation`

### Tips

- If you specify the `Scope: *`, specify the `Component: *`.

## Templates

We store [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) in the [inno-swp-2025/.github](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025/.github) repository.

Our files include issue form templates and pull request templates (see [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms)).

These templates can be used for creating new issues and pull requests in all organization repositories.

### Issue form templates

- [Epic](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025/.github/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/epic.yml)
- Backlog:
  - [User Story](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025/.github/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/backlog-user-story.yml)

- [For last-minute changes](https://github.com/inno-swp-2025/.github/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/last-minute-change.md)

## Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) are a tool for project management on GitHub.

You can [copy](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/copying-an-existing-project) our projects and use them as templates.
