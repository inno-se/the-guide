        This form is for creating a specific, actionable development task.
        Tasks should be small enough to be completed by one person in a short amount of time.
        Each task must be linked to a parent User Story issue as a sub-issue.

        If you want to add sub-issues that are sub-tasks of this task, 
        you should create a user story issue and add those tasks there as sub-issues.

        Briefly describe what this task is for.
        Explain its role in the parent user story and what specific part of the functionality it covers.

        Example:

        Create the backend API endpoint for liking a video.
        The endpoint will handle authentication, database updates, and return the correct response codes.

        This is the technical "Definition of Done" for this task.
        List specific, verifiable, and technical outcomes.
        This is what will be checked during code review.

        Example:

        - [ ] A `POST` route is created at `/api/v1/video/{id}/like`.
        - [ ] The route is protected and requires a valid JWT.
        - [ ] A successful request returns a `200 OK` status.
        - [ ] A request for a video the user has already liked returns a `409 Conflict`.
        - [ ] A request with a non-existent `video_id` returns a `404 Not Found`.
        - [ ] Unit tests for the `LikeService` are written and pass with >90% coverage.
        - [ ] The new endpoint is documented in the OpenAPI/Swagger spec.

        Add any thoughts on the technical approach, files to be modified, potential libraries to use, or identified risks.

        Example:

        - Will modify `video.controller.ts` and `video.service.ts`.
        - Need to add a new `video_likes` table to the database schema.
        - Consider potential race conditions if a user spams the like button.
